                  Digital wallet is a software, electronic device or an online
                  application that enables transactions online. Digital wallets
                  facilitate secured transactions, valuable customer insights
                  and access to rewards such as cashback, coupons and loyalty
                  programs. To have a secure NFT collection, crypto-supported
                  digital wallets are necessary. These wallets generate a
                  private key to the address of the asset ensuring secured, safe
                  and unique ownership of the asset.
